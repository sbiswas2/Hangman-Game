# Jumpman

## Description

This app is your basic Hangman game with a Michael Jordan theme, so it is called Jumpman.  The game will start when the app is running.  A random word is chosen from the answer bank and displays the spaces associated with each letter in the answer.  As a player types a letter, the app determines if the guess is correct or incorrect.  The player will have 10 guesses to determine the answer.  If correct, the letter appears in the answer.  If incorrect, the player loses a guess.  When a game is won or lost, a GIF will appear and the app will keep track of their score.  The app will restart at the end of the game.
